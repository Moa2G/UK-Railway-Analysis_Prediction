# UK-Railway-Analysis_Prediction
This project analyses UK railway journey data (Janâ€“Apr 2024), covering ticket sales, passenger behaviour, train punctuality, and refund requests. Data cleaning, feature engineering, and modelling are implemented in Python. A Random Forest model was trained to predict refund requests with 96% accuracy.
